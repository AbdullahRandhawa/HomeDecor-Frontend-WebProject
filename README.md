This project represents a foundational exercise in front-end web development, demonstrating proficiency in core web technologies and responsive design principles. It involved building a multi-page website prototype, simulating an e-commerce platform for home decor, focusing on user interface (UI) design and interactive elements.

Key Highlights & Technologies Used:

HTML5: Structured the entire web content, including navigation bars, carousels, product grids, forms, and footers, ensuring semantic and accessible markup.

CSS3: Applied custom styling to enhance the visual appeal, manage layouts, and ensure consistency across different sections of the website.

-Responsive Navigation: A collapsible navbar for seamless Browse across devices.

-Carousel: An interactive image carousel to showcase featured content dynamically.

-Grid System: Structured product listings and other content using Bootstrap's flexible grid system for adaptive layouts.

-Forms & Buttons: Designed user-friendly login and sign-up pages with well-structured forms and Bootstrap-styled buttons for clear calls to action.

-Cards: Implemented product displays using Bootstrap Cards to present items clearly and consistently.

-User Interface Design: Focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user experience, integrating common e-commerce UI patterns.

Project Scope: The project includes a homepage (index.html) featuring product categories, deals, and promotional sections; a dedicated login page (log-in.html); and a sign-up page (sin-up.html) for new users.

This project was a comprehensive learning experience that solidified understanding of modern front-end web development workflows, emphasizing the integration of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to build robust and responsive web interfaces
